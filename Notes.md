In JavaScript, when you declare a variable using var, let, or const, its scope is determined by where it is physically written in the code. This is sometimes referred to as "static" or "lexical" scoping. Variables declared inside a block of code, such as a function or a loop, are only accessible within that block and any nested blocks. They are not accessible outside of those blocks.
